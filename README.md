# STViG-for-READS-V
The code will be released soon!
In this project, we propose a novel skeleton-based spatiotemporal vision graph neural network (STViG) for efficient, accurate, and timely REal-time Automated Detection of epileptic Seizures from surveillance Videos (READS-V).
Previous video-based seizure detection studies did not rely on skeleton information because the public pre-tained pose estimation model cannot track the patient poses accurately. We manually annotate the pose label for the patients, and train our own custom for patient pose estimation.
